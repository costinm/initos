# Istio and InitOS

The InitOS was started in part due to frustrations with Grub/Dracut/Systemd - but most of the design is based on Istio 'zero trust' and
an earlier project for Android attempting to create a secure mesh.

Outside of cloud, for 'on prem' or 'at home' servers that lack custom firmware, securing the boot and encrypted disks is far too
complicated - Linux distros are mostly focused on single machine
running bloated desktop, not on secure fleet of machines.
