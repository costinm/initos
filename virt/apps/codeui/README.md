Example for building a VM using containers - with chrome and code.

Both work better in VM than containers.

Usually chrome is logged in and has access to a lot of private data - better to keep it isolated. Code should be used for remote edit.

Home dir:
- .config/Code
- .vscode
- .local/share/keyrings ( using libsecret / seahorse to see )
